            <h1> Ninja Warrior</h1>


            <h4>The case</h4>
            <p>American Ninja Warrior (sometimes abbreviated as ANW) is an American sports entertainment
                competition, which is a spin-off of the Japanese television series Sasuke. It features hundreds of
                competitors attempting to complete series of obstacle courses of increasing difficulty in various cities
                across the United States, in hopes of advancing to the national finals on the Las Vegas Strip and becoming the season's
                "American Ninja Warrior." </p>
            <img src="images/logo ninja warrior.jpg" alt=" smallninjalogo">
            <h4> The assignment </h4>
            <p>Design a mobile friendly application where the users are the gyms and the people who would like to
                practice this sport. </p>

            <p>The first platform is for the gym itself. Gyms should be able to offer a training for
                certain levels (Beginner, average and expert and mixed), and for Male, Female and mixed genders. </p>
            <h5>Gyms should be able to: </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a training that people can book</li>
                <li> People have to be able to pay for the training or pay with a stamp system</li>
                <li>Teachers have to be able to check everyone in before a training begins</li>
                <li>Add a teacher </li>
                <li>Show the available obstacles </li>
                <li>Show the location, time and duration of a training session </li>

            </ul>

            <p>The second platform is for the people who like to train for Ninja Warrior but also like to
                offer a training in a park or at their house (for example)</p>

            <h5>People who go to the gym should be able to: </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a profile and an account</li>
                <li>Create a training as well that people can book</li>
                <li> People should be able to pay for the training or pay with a stamp system</li>
                <li>Buy a stampcard </li>
                <li>Show the available obstacles </li>
                <li>Show the location, time and duration of a training session </li>
                <li>Leave a review of the training, teacher and gym</li>
                <li>See all the exsisting obstacles</li>
                <li>Add lessons to favorites</li>
            </ul>
